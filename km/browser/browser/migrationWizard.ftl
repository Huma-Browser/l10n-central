## These strings are shown if the selected browser data directory is unreadable.
## In practice, this tends to only occur on Linux when Firefox
## is installed as a Snap.


## These strings will be displayed based on how many resources are selected to import

# A description for the .csv file format that may be shown as the file type
# filter by the operating system.
migration-passwords-from-file-csv-filter-title =
    { PLATFORM() ->
        [macos] ឯកសារ CSV
       *[other] CSV File

# A description for the .tsv file format that may be shown as the file type
# filter by the operating system. TSV is short for 'tab separated values'.

## These strings will be used to create a dynamic list of items that can be
## imported. The list will be created using Intl.ListFormat(), so it will
## follow each locale's rules, and the first item will be capitalized by code.
## When applicable, the resources should be in their plural form.
## For example, a possible list could be "Bookmarks, passwords and autofill data".

## The import process identifies extensions installed in other supported
## browsers and installs the corresponding (matching) extensions compatible
## with Firefox, if available.
