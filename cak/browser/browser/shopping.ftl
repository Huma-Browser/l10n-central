## Strings for the letter grade component.
## For now, we only support letter grades A, B, C, D and F.
## Letter A indicates the highest grade, and F indicates the lowest grade.
## Letters are hardcoded and cannot be localized.

# This string is displayed in a tooltip that appears when the user hovers
# over the letter grade component without a visible description.
# It is also used for screen readers.
#  $letter (String) - The letter grade as A, B, C, D or F (hardcoded).
#  $description (String) - The localized letter grade description. See shopping-letter-grade-description-* strings above.
