## The Enterprise Policies feature is aimed at system administrators
## who want to deploy these settings across several Firefox installations
## all at once. This is traditionally done through the Windows Group Policy
## feature, but the system also supports other forms of deployment.
## These are short descriptions for individual policies, to be displayed
## in the documentation section in about:policies.

policy-DisableFormHistory = Ná cuimhnigh ar nithe a chuardaítear agus nithe a gcuirtear isteach i bhfoirmeacha.

## Do not translate "SameSite", it's the name of a cookie attribute.


##

policy-SearchBar = Socraigh ionad réamhshocraithe an bharra seolta. Tá cead fós ag an úsáideoir é a shaincheapú dó féin.

policy-SearchSuggestEnabled = Cumasaigh nó díchumasaigh moltaí cuardaigh.
