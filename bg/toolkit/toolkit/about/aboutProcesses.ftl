## Displaying CPU (percentage and total)
## Variables:
##    $percent (Number) The percentage of CPU used by the process or thread.
##                      Always > 0, generally <= 200.
##    $total (Number) The amount of time used by the process or thread since
##                    its start.
##    $unit (String) The unit in which to display $total. See the definitions
##                   of `duration-unit-*`.

# Special case: process or thread is almost idle (using less than 0.1% of a CPU core).
# This case only occurs on Windows where the precision of the CPU times is low.
about-processes-cpu-almost-idle = < 0.1%

## Displaying Memory (total and delta)
## Variables:
##    $total (Number) The amount of memory currently used by the process.

##                        of `memory-unit-*`.
##    $delta (Number) The absolute value of the amount of memory added recently.
##    $deltaSign (String) Either "+" if the amount of memory has increased
##                        or "-" if it has decreased.
##    $deltaUnit (String) The unit in which to display $delta. See the definitions
##                        of `memory-unit-*`.
