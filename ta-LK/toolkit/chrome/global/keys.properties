# F1..F10 should probably not be translated unless there are keyboards that actually have other labels
# F11..F20 might be something else, but are really keyboard specific and not region/language specific
# there are actually two different F11/F12 keys, I don't know which one these labels represent.
# eg, F13..F20 on a sparc keyboard are labeled Props, Again .. Find, Cut
# sparc also has Stop, Again and F11/F12. VK_F11/VK_F12 probably map to Stop/Again
# LOCALIZATION NOTE : BLOCK Do not translate the next block

# Enter, backspace, and Tab might have both glyphs and text
# if the keyboards usually have a glyph,
# if there is a meaningful translation,
# or if keyboards are localized
# then translate them or insert the appropriate glyph
# otherwise you should probably just translate the glyph regions
