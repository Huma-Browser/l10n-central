## These strings are shown if the selected browser data directory is unreadable.
## In practice, this tends to only occur on Linux when Firefox
## is installed as a Snap.


## These strings will be displayed based on how many resources are selected to import


##


## These strings will be used to create a dynamic list of items that can be
## imported. The list will be created using Intl.ListFormat(), so it will
## follow each locale's rules, and the first item will be capitalized by code.
## When applicable, the resources should be in their plural form.
## For example, a possible list could be "Bookmarks, passwords and autofill data".


##


## The import process identifies extensions installed in other supported
## browsers and installs the corresponding (matching) extensions compatible
## with Firefox, if available.
