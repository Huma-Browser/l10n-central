# The following strings have special requirements: they must fit in a 32 or 64

# It's possible to verify the length of a translation using the Browser Console
# in Firefox and evaluating the following code:
#
# (new TextEncoder('utf-8').encode('YOURSTRING')).length
#
# Simply replace YOURSTRING with your translation.
#
# If it's not possible to produce an understandable translation within these
# limits, keeping the English text is an acceptable workaround.

PSMERR_SSL_Disabled=Can’t connect securely because the SSL protocol has been disabled.
PSMERR_SSL2_Disabled=Can’t connect securely because the site uses an older, insecure version of the SSL protocol.
PSMERR_HostReusedIssuerSerial=You have received an invalid certificate.  Please contact the server administrator or email correspondent and give them the following information:\n\nYour certificate contains the same serial number as another certificate issued by the certificate authority.  Please get a new certificate containing a unique serial number.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (SSLConnectionErrorPrefix2): %1$S is the host string, %2$S is more detailed information (localized as well).

certErrorIntro=%S ay gumagamit ng imbalidong katiwasayang sertipiko.

certErrorTrust_SelfSigned=Ang certificate ay hindi pinagkakatiwalaan dahil ito ay sariling-pirma lamang.
certErrorTrust_UnknownIssuer=Ang certificate ay hindi pinagkakatiwalaan dahil ang gumawa ng certificate ay hindi kilala.
certErrorTrust_UnknownIssuer2=The server might not be sending the appropriate intermediate certificates.
certErrorTrust_UnknownIssuer3=An additional root certificate may need to be imported.
certErrorTrust_CaInvalid=The certificate is not trusted because it was issued by an invalid CA certificate.
certErrorTrust_Issuer=The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is not trusted.
certErrorTrust_SignatureAlgorithmDisabled=The certificate is not trusted because it was signed using a signature algorithm that was disabled because that algorithm is not secure.
certErrorTrust_ExpiredIssuer=Ang sertipiko ay hindi pinagkakatiwalaan dahil ang issuer ng sertipiko ay expired na.
certErrorTrust_Untrusted=Ang certificate ay hindi galing sa pinagkakatiwalaang pinangalingan.
certErrorTrust_MitM=Your connection is being intercepted by a TLS proxy. Uninstall it if possible or configure your device to trust its root certificate.

certErrorMismatch=Ang certificate ay hindi maaari para sa pangalang %S.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (certErrorMismatchSinglePrefix): %S is replaced by the domain for which the certificate is valid
certErrorMismatchSinglePrefix=The certificate is only valid for %S.
certErrorMismatchMultiple=Ang certificate ay maaari lamang sa mga sumusunod na pangalan:

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (certErrorExpiredNow): Do not translate %1$S (date+time of expired certificate) or %2$S (current date+time)
certErrorExpiredNow=Ang sertipiko ay expired sa %1$S. Ang kasalukuyang oras ay %2$S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (certErrorNotYetValidNow): Do not translate %1$S (date+time certificate will become valid) or %2$S (current date+time)
certErrorNotYetValidNow=Ang certificate ay hindi magiging wasto hanggang %1$S. Ang kasalukuyang oras ay %2$S.

certErrorMitM=Websites prove their identity via certificates, which are issued by certificate authorities.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (certErrorMitM2): %S is brandShortName
certErrorMitM2=%S is backed by the non-profit Mozilla, which administers a completely open certificate authority (CA) store. The CA store helps ensure that certificate authorities are following best practices for user security.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (certErrorMitM3): %S is brandShortName
certErrorMitM3=%S uses the Mozilla CA store to verify that a connection is secure, rather than certificates supplied by the user’s operating system. So, if an antivirus program or a network is intercepting a connection with a security certificate issued by a CA that is not in the Mozilla CA store, the connection is considered unsafe.

certErrorSymantecDistrustAdministrator=You may notify the website’s administrator about this problem.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (certErrorCodePrefix3): %S is replaced by the error code.
certErrorCodePrefix3=Error code: %S
