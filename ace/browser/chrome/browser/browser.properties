# LOCALIZATION NOTE (contentBlocking.trackers.blocking.label):
#   This label signals that this type of content blocking is turned
#   ON and is successfully blocking tracker content, so this is
#   a positive thing. However, it is important to note that there is no
#   guarantee that we _actually_ blocked anything, hence we present it
#   in the present tense, not the past tense in English. The idea is that
#   past tense would imply that something was blocked, while present
#   tense expresses that we are waiting for trackers to load
#   and will block them as appropriate. This concept may not directly
#   translate to your language, but it is still preferable if the translation
#   would not make it seem like the blocking had already happened.
#   So in full context this word could be part of the sentence:
#   "[Firefox is] Blocking [trackers when they get loaded.]"
